<!--You are never really playing an opponent. You are playing yourself, your own highest standards, and when you reach your limit, that is the real joy. However, the road to trying to do our best can be quite bumpy and stressful. Not because we face a tough opponent, it's because we face ourselves. The greatest athletes know that sports aren't just about winning. Winning is just the end result. Gold medals aren't really made of gold. They're made of sweat, determination, and a hard-to-find alloy called guts.And-->

 It is because combinations are possible that Chess is more than a lifeless mathematical exercise. 
They are the poetry of the game; they are to Chess what melody is to music.
 They represent the triumph of mind over matter.<br><br>

"Daring ideas are like chessmen moved forward. They may be beaten, but they may start a winning game."  <br> -Johann Wolfgang von Goethe
